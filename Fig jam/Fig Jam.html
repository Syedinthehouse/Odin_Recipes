            Being a recipe developer comes with perks, like when friends unexpectedly deliver their garden surplus to my doorstep. From basil and tomatoes to what I lovingly call the “inevitable zucchini tsunami,” I welcome it all. My latest doorstep surprise was a mountain of figs from my friend Sheri. She’s lucky enough to have three fig trees in her backyard that bear so much fruit, she’s not quite sure what to do with it all. My first thought: fig jam. It’s so simple to make. There’s no hassle of peeling or deseeding the figs. Just stem, chop, and toss the fruit with lemon juice, sugar, water, and a hint of citrus rind. Within an hour, you’ve got a fig jam that tops any store-bought version. The best part is its versatility. Think bread toppings, cheese, and charcuterie pairings, sandwich spreads (it’s amazing on grilled cheese), or just a thoughtful jarred gift.

    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <OL>
        <li>2 pounds ripe figs,stemmed and diced</li>
        <li>1 and half cups sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>Half cup of water</li>
        <li>4 one-inch-thick strips of orange or lemon peel(or a combination),making sure to avoid the white pith</li>
    </OL>
    <br>
    <h2>STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS</h2>

    <li>In a large, nonreactive saucepan, toss the fig pieces with the sugar, lemon juice, water, and citrus peels. (A nonreactive saucepan is made from materials that do not react with acidic ingredients, such as stainless steel or enamel-coated cookware. It is used to prevent a metallic taste or discoloration that can occur when acidic ingredients like citrus come into contact with reactive materials like aluminum or copper.)

    </li>
    <li>Bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved.

    </li>
    <li>Simmer the fig jam over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally and mashing the fig pieces.</li>
    <li>Cook until the fruit is soft and jammy, 35 to 45 minutes.

    </li>
    <li>Discard the citrus peels and spoon the jam into three 10-oz jars, leaving 1/4 inch of space at the top. Close the jars and let cool to room temperature. Store the jam in the refrigerator for up to 3 months.</li>
