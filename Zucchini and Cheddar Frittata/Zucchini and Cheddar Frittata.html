            I always love the idea of a frittata. Within 30 minutes, you can whip up a meal that makes good use of any leftover veggies, meat, or hunks of cheese hiding out in the fridge. But for all their perks, frittatas can often be a bit “meh” — for the same calories, give me a slice of quiche any day! This zucchini frittata

    <h2>STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Begin by grating the zucchini by hand or in a food processor. It’s best to use small zucchini, as they contain less water.</li>
        <li>Once grated, place the zucchini on several layers of paper towels and squeeze out as much water as possible. Depending on how much water is in the zucchini, you may need to repeat this step.

        </li>
        <li>Next, melt a few tablespoons of butter in a 10-inch cast iron or oven-proof nonstick pan.</li>
        <li>Add the shallots, zucchini, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

        </li>
        <li>Cook for 7 to 8 minutes, until the zucchini is tender and cooked down.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine the eggs, remaining salt, pepper and heavy cream in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked zucchini and grated cheese to the egg mixture and stir.

        </li>
        <li>Pour the frittata mixture back into the pan.

        </li>
        <li>Bake for about 25 to 30 minutes, or until just set.</li>
        <li>Serve the frittata warm or room temperature.</li>
    </ul>
