 Tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches are best when the air turns crisp, the mornings are damp, and the days are short. The soup’s simplicity only accentuates its role as a tincture on a cold fall evening. Its velvety texture is a robe of warmth.

</p>
<p>This tomato soup is my go-to during the chilly fall and winter months when fresh tomatoes are out of season. It’s a simple recipe, using canned tomatoes and everyday pantry staples. The soup gets its creamy texture from blending the tomatoes themselves—no heavy cream required. A little chef’s trick I use is adding a bit of sugar. This might seem unconventional, but it perfectly balances the natural acidity of the tomatoes.</p>
<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<OL>
    <li>Tomatoes</li>
    <li>chicken</li>
    <li>garlic cloves</li>
    <li>onion</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
</OL>
<h2> <strong>STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS</strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li>In a large nonreactive pot, heat the olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter over medium-low heat. When butter is melted, add the onions and cook over medium-low/medium heat, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent. Do not brown.

    </li>
    <li>Add the garlic and cook for a few minutes more, stirring to be sure garlic does not burn.</li>
    <li>Stir in the flour and continue cooking and stirring for 1 to 2 minutes more.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken broth, tomatoes, sugar, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</li>
    <li>Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat while stirring to make sure that the flour is not sticking to the bottom or sides of the pan. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for about 30 minutes.

    </li>
    <li>Use a hand-held immersion blender to puree soup until very smooth. (Alternatively, let the soup cool slightly and puree in batches in a blender. Be sure to crack the lid or remove the center cap to allow steam to escape.) Season to taste with salt and pepper.

    </li>
    <li>Stir in remaining 3 tablespoons of butter.</li>
    <li>Ladle soup into bowls and garnish with fresh basil, croutons, and a generous sprinkling of Parmigiano-Reggiano.
